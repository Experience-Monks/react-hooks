# What's this

Collection of hooks that we re-use at Jam3

# Why?

Since the React landscape is changing with the introduction of hooks
and the "deprecation" of classes is useful for us to keep a collection
of hooks so we can share functionality between projects.

You could face 3 cases

1. The functionality that you need is already here so just `npm install`
2. There is some missing functionality so you want to make the hook
   dynamic to multiple cases well open a PR
3. Your use case is too specific, just copy and paste the hook and adapt it these way at least you're not starting from 0 and with best practices

## Install

```bash
npm install @jam3/react-hooks
yarn add @jam3/react-hooks
```

## Usage

```jsx
// Import depending what you need it will tree-shake the modules
import { useIntersectionObserver } from "@jam3/react-hooks";
import { useMousePosition } from "@jam3/react-hooks";
import { useOnHover } from "@jam3/react-hooks";
import { useScrollDirection } from "@jam3/react-hooks";
import { useScrollProgress } from "@jam3/react-hooks";
import { useScrollToTop } from "@jam3/react-hooks";
import { useWindowSize } from "@jam3/react-hooks";
```
