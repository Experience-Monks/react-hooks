# What's this

Collection of useful hooks that we re-use at Jam3

# Why?

The react landscape has been changing rapidly since the introduction of hooks in early 2019 with [16.8.0](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1680-february-6-2019),
know you could effectively only use functional components with hooks.

The idea of this library is hold useful hooks to be quicky added to new and existing projects.

For more information about hooks go to the official [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
and also watch this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM) by the React team.

You could face 3 cases

1. The functionality that you need is already here so just run `npm install`.
2. There is some missing functionality, you could make a PR to improve the docs and make it more dynamic for example.
3. Your use case is too specific, just copy and paste the hook and adapt it to your needs, this way you at least have an starting point.

## Install

```bash
npm install @jam3/react-hooks
yarn add @jam3/react-hooks
```

## Usage

```jsx
// Import depending what you need it will tree-shake the modules
import { useIntersectionObserver } from "@jam3/react-hooks";
